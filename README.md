Abstract. The strong detuning of phoXonic (photonic and phononic) frequency modes is useful to realize multi-spectral, low-loss on-chip lightwave sensing and propagation at conventional wavelengths. In this work, w.r.t third-order nonlinear brillouin frequency shifts dominantly observed at midwave infrared (MWIR) wavelengths, we propose a parity-time (PT) symmetric formalism to model the thermal density perturbations with a low-intensity coherent photon state as the input and a method to suppress the generated complex phonon frequencies representing those perturbations and enhance the photonic bandwidth when coupling through a phoxonic cavity or a phoxonic waveguide. We modelled and analyzed the formalism using quantum as well as FDTD simulations respectively for both cavity and waveguide modes to demonstrate simultaneous phoxonic behavior for a wavelength range 3-5Âµm. In the notion that conserving the scattering losses seeks careful dispersion engineering, the effects and applications of suppressing/enhancing the complex phonon frequencies have been discussed.
